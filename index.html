  <strong>About</strong>
  <p>
    Qiang Wang (王强) is a PhD student at at the University of BIT, advised by Prof. Davide Scaramuzza.  
    Prior to RPG, he obtained his Msc degree in Information and Communication Engineering from Technische Universität Darmstadt.
    His master thesis entitled "Minimax and Entropic Proximal Policy Optimization" was written under the supervision
    of Prof. Jan Peters.

  <p>
    Yunlong's reearch interests lie at the intersection of perception, planning, and control. 
    He contributed novel control algorithms, blending policy search with model-predictive control, end-to-end control techniques, and 
    hybrid methods integrating classical planning with approximate dynamic programming. Furthermore, he worked on 
    deep sensorimotor policies for vision-based agile flight, leveraging visual representation and behavior cloning, 
    underscored by the importance of robust visual feature consistency through contrastive learning and data augmentation.
    Yunlong has contributed two pivotal software tools: Flightmare, focused on high-speed, photorealistic simulations, 
    and Agilicious, a combined hardware-software testing framework. 


  <p>
    Yunlong was born and grew up in a small <a style="color:#081b86; font-weight:bold" href="{{site.baseurl}}/images/home.jpg">village</a> in Southern China.
